## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learn the idea of the divs and simple property alignments. Also it give me the idea of using z-index to make your element in front of other element.

I know this is a very basic for other people, but it open doors for me:)

```css
.content{
  background-color: #fff;
  width: 300px;
  margin: auto;
  border-radius: 15px;
  font-size: 0.8rem;
  color: hsl(229, 23%, 23%);
  z-index: 1;
  overflow: hidden;
}

```


### Continued development

For now i want to learn the basics and fundaments of css html and javascript. I'm really bad on designing but I'm trying to make it.
